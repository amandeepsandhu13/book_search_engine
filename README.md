MERN: Book Search Engine
This project is a Google Books search engine built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The application allows users to search for books, view book details, and save books to their personal library. User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
